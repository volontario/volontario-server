volontario API
==============
* All responses are formatted as JSON.
* To use any `POST` or `DELETE` commands except `POST /users`, you have to authenticate via HTTP Basic Auth. Create a user and use the same credentials as given to the newly made user when creating or deleting things. This is to be able to match things to their creators and deleters.

### Notes on `PATCH`
`PATCH` requests are formatted as specified in RFC6902. The only supported operation is `replace`.

For example, to update the `startsAt` field of an event, send the following body to `/events/:id`:

```json
{
	"op": "replace",
	"path": "/startsAt",
	"value": "2015-12-30T21:10:03.772Z"
}
```

The response should then be an empty `204`.

Root
----

#### `GET /`
Returns an empty object as a status check. Consider Redis's `PONG`.

Locations
---------

#### `GET /locations`
Returns a list of locations.

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|:--------|
| category | Filter by category |

#### `GET /locations/:id`
Returns a location with the provided `id`.

#### `GET /locations/:id/:field`
Returns a specific field of a location with the provided `id`. Has to be used to fetch expensive fields.

#### `POST /locations`
Enters a location into the system. Returns `201` on success.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|:---- |:--------|
| category | `string` | Category, e.g. "bloodServiceCentre" |
| latitude | `float` | Latitude |
| longitude | `float` | Longitude |
| name | `string` | Name of the location |
| url | `string` | URL for the location |

#### `DELETE /locations`
Deletes locations that match the appropriate fields (described in the above `POST`). If no field is given i.e. everything is to be deleted, the API will throw an error *unless* it is given a `notVague` override with the value `true`.

On success, returns either `205` or `204` depending on whether anything was actually deleted.

#### `DELETE /locations/:id`
Deletes a location with the provided `id`. Returns `204` on success.

Events
------

#### `GET /events`
Returns a list of events.

#### `GET /events/:id`
Returns an event with the provided `id`.

#### `GET /events/:id/calender`
Works exactly as you would expect. Except, you could give the request a `inverted` field, though, and set it to `true`. Then, instead of *reserved* times, you would get the *free* times of the calendar.

#### `GET /events/:id/:field`
Returns a specific field of an event with the provided `id`. Has to be used to fetch expensive fields such as calendars.

#### `POST /events`
Enters an event into the system. Returns `201` on success.

| longitude | `float` | Longitude |
